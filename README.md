# Wecome to my personal repo of nonsense!

So far I plan on using this to track what I'm working on and ideas I've had that I may eventually work on.

The list lives [here](https://github.com/yaahc/yaahc/issues/1)

This repo may eventually do other things as well! Who knows *mysterious hand waving*.
